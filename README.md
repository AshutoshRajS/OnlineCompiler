#  Online  Compiler 
This project provides an online compiler for C code, built using Flask and Monaco Editor. It allows users to write and run C code directly from their browser. In the future, it will be upgraded to support multiple programming languages with an improved user interface.

## Features
Code Editor: Monaco Editor for syntax highlighting and code editing.

Run Code: Execute C code directly in the browser and see the output.

Simple and Clean UI: Designed for ease of use, with a responsive interface.

Scalable: Future updates will support multiple programming languages (e.g., Python, Java, JavaScript).

## Technologies Used
### Frontend:

Monaco Editor: A fast, feature-rich code editor.

HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for dynamic content and interaction).

Fetch API for communication with the backend.

### Backend:

Flask: A micro web framework for Python.

CORS: To allow cross-origin requests.

Pythonâ€™s subprocess: To compile and run C code on the server.
Other:

UUID: For generating unique filenames for the code and output.

Regular expressions (regex) for handling language-specific logic, like class names in Java.

## Setup and Installation
- Clone the Repository:

	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/AshutoshRajS/OnlineCompiler.git
	cd OnlineCompiler

Install Dependencies:
-  Install Python 3 and the required libraries via pip:

	```bash
	pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Application:
-	To start the Flask application locally, run the following    command:
    ```bash
	python app.py
	Open your browser and visit http://127.0.0.1:5000 to start using the online compiler.

## Usage
Write Code: Write your C code in the Monaco editor.

Run Code: Click the "Run Code" button to compile and execute the code.

View Output: The output of your code will appear below the editor.
Backend Overview

/run: Accepts POST requests with the user's code and language preference.

Currently supports C language for compiling and running the code.
The backend executes the code via gcc and returns the output or error messages.

## Future Upgrades

The project will be upgraded in the future to support more programming languages. Features planned for the next version include:

Multi-Language Support: Support for Python, Java, JavaScript, and more.
Improved UI: A more modern, feature-rich design.
Enhanced Features: Support for saving code, managing user sessions, and sharing code snippets.
