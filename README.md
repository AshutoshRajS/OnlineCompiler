# Online Compiler 

This project provides an online compiler with multi-language support. It allows users to write, compile, and run code in different programming languages using the Monaco Editor for code editing and a backend server for running the code.

## Features
- Multi-Language Support: Currently supports C, C++, Python, Java, and JavaScript.
- Code Editor: Monaco Editor for syntax highlighting and code editing.

- Run Code: Execute C/python/java/javscript code directly in the browser and see the output.

- Simple and Clean UI: Designed for ease of use, with a responsive interface.
- Resizable Panels: The editor and output panels are resizable for a better user experience.

Scalable: Future updates will support multiple programming languages 

## Technologies Used
### Frontend:

Monaco Editor: A fast, feature-rich code editor.

HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for dynamic content and interaction).

Fetch API for communication with the backend.

### Backend:

Flask: A micro web framework for Python.

CORS: To allow cross-origin requests.

Pythonâ€™s subprocess: To compile and run C code on the server.
Other:

UUID: For generating unique filenames for the code and output.

Regular expressions (regex) for handling language-specific logic, like class names in Java.

## Setup and Installation
- Clone the Repository:

	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/AshutoshRajS/OnlineCompiler.git
	cd OnlineCompiler

Install Dependencies:
-  Install Python 3 and the required libraries via pip:

	```bash
	pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Application:
-	To start the Flask application locally, run the following    command:
    ```bash
	python app.py
	Open your browser and visit http://127.0.0.1:5000 to start using the online compiler.

## Usage
Write Code: Write your code in the Monaco editor.

Run Code: Click the "Run Code" button to compile and execute the code.

View Output: The output of your code will appear below the editor.
Backend Overview

/run: Accepts POST requests with the user's code and language preference.

Currently supports C/Python/CPP/Java/Javascript language for compiling and running the code.
The backend executes the c /cpp code via gcc and returns the output or error messages.

## Future Upgrades

The project will be upgraded in the future to support more programming languages. Features planned for the next version include:

Improved UI: A more modern, feature-rich design.
Enhanced Features: Support for saving code, managing user sessions, and sharing code snippets.
